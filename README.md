# C# Player's Guide - Final Boss Battle
This repo is for recording my attempt at the Final Boss Battle in RB Whitaker's C# developer guide. The final coding project from the book is spread across 18 individual challenges, culminating a turn-based RPG. As with any battler, two parties, one consisting of friendly adventurers, the other made up by the forces of evil, will take turns attacking until one party's hit points are depleted/all characters defeated. Each character will be represented with unique characteristics and a range of attacks. Enemies will be varied with the last boss, The Uncoded One, presenting the final challenging round.

The book suggests all challenges are undertaken in/delivered via the Console. However, for a personal challenge, I wanted to build the project in Unity and present the project with a polished GUI (whilst still meeting all of the objectives/specification).

The final game will be able to be played with 1 player (vs. CPU) or 2 players.

## Current Challenge: The True Programmer
### Objectives
+ Allow player to enter a custom name for their character

## Building Character
### Objectives
+ Game loop that supports two parties (heroes vs monsters)
+ Each battle round every character will get to take one action, alternating between parties
+ For this challenge, each party has one skeleton
+ Skeleton represented with nameplate
+ Communicate whos turn it is to the player
+ Support single action of 'do nothing'
+ The game will run automatically given there's no active actions to take
+ [Stretch] Arguably necessary - add a time limit to take action before default action is taken
### State of the project at the end of this challenge:
